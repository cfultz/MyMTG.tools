            <h3>Rulings Database Integration</h3> <p>MyMTG.tools integrates with popular MTG databases like Scryfall and Gatherer to provide comprehensive rulings for individual cards. This ensures that players have access to accurate and up-to-date information about card interactions and gameplay mechanics, helping them make informed decisions during matches.</p>
